            <h2 id="personal-info">My Educational Background & Technical Journey</h2>
            <From class="info">I completed my Form 4 education, which laid the academic foundation for my continued growth in technology and software development. While formal education provided structure and discipline, my true learning journey expanded far beyond the classroom through curiosity, hands-on practice, and consistent self-improvement. From an early stage, I developed a strong interest in computers, not just using them, but understanding how they work. This curiosity led me to explore computer maintenance, where I gained practical knowledge in troubleshooting hardware and software issues, system setup, optimization, and general computer care. Understanding the physical and system-level components of a machine gave me a deeper appreciation of how software interacts with hardware. In addition to computer maintenance, I built foundational skills in Python programming. With basic knowledge in Python, I understand core programming concepts such as variables, control flow, functions, and problem-solving logic. Learning Python strengthened my analytical thinking and introduced me to structured programming principles that apply across many languages and technologies.</p>
            <Beyond class="info">Over time, I also developed moderate knowledge in operating systems. I understand how operating systems manage processes, memory, files, and system resources. My familiarity with system environments "particularly Windows" has helped me navigate system configurations, virtualization settings, software installation, and performance tuning. This knowledge supports my development workflow and strengthens my troubleshooting capabilities. Beyond formal studies, I actively invest in self-learning and practical experience. As a passionate Frontend Web Developer operating under the name D3F4U17,  I continuously sharpen my skills in modern web technologies. I focus on building responsive, user-friendly interfaces while following best practices in clean code, performance optimization, and maintainability.</p>

            <h3 class="meta-header">Concluision</h3>
            <p class="meta-content">As someone who balances school, work, and personal technical growth, I believe continuous learning is the key to success in technology. My journey reflects self-discipline, curiosity, and a commitment to growth. I may have completed Form 4 as my formal academic milestone, but my real education continues every day through coding, experimentation, and problem-solving. I am driven by the belief that technology is not just about writing code, it is about building solutions, improving systems, and creating meaningful digital experiences.</p>
